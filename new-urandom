# While statistically unlikely, it is not impossible that the 1k of random data your dd command is pulling will not have enough printable
# characters for what will ultimately be your password output.

# I was thinking this command might replace lines 8,11,14.
# This pulls :graph: characters (https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/html_node/Character-Classes-and-Bracket-Expressions.html)
# from urandom until there are enough to satisfy the number of characters in the head command.
# This way there is zero chance of not having enough characters (OK, odds of winning the lotter type stuff, but still).
< /dev/urandom tr -cd "[:graph:]" | head -c $1; echo
